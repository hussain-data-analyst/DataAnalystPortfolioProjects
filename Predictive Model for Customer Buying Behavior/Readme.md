# Predictive Model for Customer Buying Behavior

## 🎯 Objective
Develop a predictive model to identify the likelihood of customers completing flight or holiday bookings. This empowers airlines to make proactive, data-driven decisions for customer acquisition and enhanced marketing strategies.

## 🚀 Approach
1. **Data Preparation**: Cleaned and preprocessed customer booking data to ensure high-quality inputs for modeling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed trends and relationships among variables like purchase lead time, trip type, and customer preferences.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extracted key features, such as customer preferences for extra baggage, meals, and booking behavior.
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Built machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict booking completion.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Achieved **83% accuracy** with the best-performing model, while interpreting feature importance for actionable insights.

## 💻 Technologies and Tools
- **Programming**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## 🌟 Key Findings and Insights
- Variables like **purchase lead time**, **length of stay**, and **customer preferences** significantly influenced booking completion.
- The predictive model demonstrated strong potential for reliable predictions, enabling **proactive marketing strategies**.

## 🏆 Results
This project highlighted the effectiveness of predictive analytics in targeting potential customers, facilitating **data-driven decision-making** for marketing and customer acquisition.
