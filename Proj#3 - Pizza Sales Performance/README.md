*   **Bottom 5 Pizzas by Total Orders:** Identifies pizzas with the least number of orders.

## Tools and Technologies Used

*   **SQL Server:** Used for data extraction and querying.
*   **Power BI:** Used for data visualization and creating interactive dashboards.

## How to Run the Project

1.  **SQL Queries:**
    *   Refer to the [PIZZA SALES SQL QUERIES.pdf](https://github.com/hussain-data-analyst/DataAnalystPortfolioProjects/blob/main/Proj%233%20-%20Pizza%20Sales%20Performance/PIZZA%20SALES%20SQL%20QUERIES.pdf) file for the SQL commands used for data extraction.
2.  **Power BI Dashboard:**
    *   Open the [pizza Sales.pbix](https://github.com/hussain-data-analyst/DataAnalystPortfolioProjects/blob/main/Proj%233%20-%20Pizza%20Sales%20Performance/pizza%20Sales.pbix) file in Power BI to view the interactive dashboards.
